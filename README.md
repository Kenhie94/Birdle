# Birdle - Word Guessing Game

# Description

We wanted to build a game and decided on the inspiration of Wordle. 

- All the members of the CodePaw team like playing different types of games. 
- We wanted to build Birdle because we thought it would be fun to figure out how to build it. 
- The game solves the problem of keeping your mind busy for short periods of time. 
- We learned a lot about breaking a project into smaller pieces and how to use the GitHub project feature.

We used Bootstrap CSS for the modals. We were inspired by Wordle - we are not selling Birdle and it is for education purposes only. 


# Features

Features include selecting four letter words. The game displays using colors whether the correct letter in the correct spot, the correct letter in the wrong spot and the wrong letter that isn't included in the winning word.
